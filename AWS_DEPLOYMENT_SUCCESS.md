# ðŸŽ‰ AWS MCP Server Deployment Complete!

## Deployment Summary

Your Voltasis MCP Server is now fully deployed and configured on AWS!

### âœ… What's Been Completed

1. **AWS Infrastructure Deployed**
   - API Gateway: `https://u77ssoo8lc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/`
   - CloudFront CDN: `https://d3egiamf8dxoxo.cloudfront.net`
   - S3 Bucket: `voltasis-mcp-docs-dev`
   - DynamoDB Table: `voltasis-mcp-index-dev`
   - Lambda Functions: MCP Server, Document Processor, Index Builder

2. **Documentation Uploaded**
   - 5 markdown documents uploaded to S3
   - Index file created and uploaded
   - CloudFront cache invalidated

3. **Cursor IDE Configured**
   - MCP client configured with AWS endpoint
   - API key automatically retrieved and configured
   - Configuration saved to Cursor settings

### ðŸ§ª API Test Result

The MCP server is working correctly:
```json
{
    "serverInfo": {
        "name": "Voltasis API Documentation Server",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "environment": "dev"
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Cursor
Close and restart Cursor IDE for the MCP configuration to take effect.

### 2. Test MCP Tools in Cursor
After restarting, try these commands in Cursor:
- "What API endpoints are available?"
- "Show me the documentation for creating time entries"
- "Search for user management endpoints"

### 3. Monitor Your Resources
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Check Lambda function logs
- **API Gateway Metrics**: Monitor API usage
- **CloudFront Analytics**: Track documentation access

## Quick Reference

### Test the API Directly
```bash
API_KEY=$(cat .env.mcp-client | grep VOLTASIS_MCP_API_KEY | cut -d'=' -f2)
curl -X POST https://u77ssoo8lc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/mcp \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

### Update Documentation
```bash
# Edit files in mcp-docs/
./scripts/upload-docs.sh dev
```

### Check Stack Status
```bash
./scripts/check-deployment.sh
```

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

âœ… **Scalability**: Auto-scales with Lambda and CloudFront  
âœ… **Security**: API key authentication, encrypted storage  
âœ… **Performance**: Global CDN distribution  
âœ… **Cost-Effective**: Pay-per-use pricing model  
âœ… **Maintenance-Free**: Fully managed AWS services  

## Troubleshooting

If MCP tools don't appear in Cursor:
1. Ensure Cursor is fully closed and restarted
2. Check the configuration file: `~/.cursor-server/User/globalStorage/cursor-mcp-config.json`
3. Verify the API is responding: Run the test curl command above
4. Check CloudWatch logs for any Lambda errors

## Total Deployment Time

- Stack creation: ~6.5 minutes (faster than expected!)
- Configuration: ~2 minutes
- **Total**: Under 10 minutes from start to finish

## Cost Estimate

With typical MCP usage:
- Lambda: < $0.01/month
- API Gateway: < $0.10/month  
- S3 & CloudFront: < $0.05/month
- DynamoDB: < $0.01/month
- **Total**: < $0.20/month

**Congratulations!** Your MCP server is now running on AWS and integrated with Cursor. The Voltasis API documentation is now accessible through AI-powered tools directly in your IDE!
